## Python Fundamentals

### 1. What is the difference between `list` and `tuple` in Python?
**Answer:** Lists are mutable, ordered collections using `[]`. Tuples are immutable, ordered collections using `()`. Lists have methods like append(), tuples don't.

### 2. Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).
**Answer:** GIL prevents multiple Python threads from executing bytecode simultaneously. It ensures thread safety but limits true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.

### 3. What are Python decorators?
**Answer:** Functions that modify or extend behavior of other functions/classes without permanently modifying them. Use `@decorator_name` syntax.

### 4. Difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`?
**Answer:** `__str__` returns human-readable string for end users. `__repr__` returns unambiguous representation for developers, should be evaluable.

### 5. What are Python generators?
**Answer:** Functions that return iterators using `yield`. They generate values on-demand, memory efficient for large datasets.

### 6. Explain `*args` and `**kwargs`.
**Answer:** `*args` passes variable number of positional arguments as tuple. `**kwargs` passes variable number of keyword arguments as dictionary.

### 7. What is the difference between `is` and `==`?
**Answer:** `is` checks object identity (same memory location). `==` checks value equality.

### 8. What are Python context managers?
**Answer:** Objects that define `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Used with `with` statement for resource management.

### 9. Explain Python's memory management.
**Answer:** Uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection. Objects are deallocated when reference count reaches zero.

### 10. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
**Answer:** Shallow copy creates new object but references to nested objects. Deep copy creates completely independent copy of object and all nested objects.
