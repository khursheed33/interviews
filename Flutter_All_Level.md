        biometricOnly: true,
      );

      if (isAuthenticated) {
        // User successfully authenticated
      } else {
        // Biometric authentication failed
      }
    }
    ```


**L1 Interview Questions:**

34. Q: What is the purpose of the InheritedWidget in Flutter?
    A: The InheritedWidget in Flutter is used for sharing data across the widget tree without the need for passing the data explicitly through constructor parameters. It allows descendant widgets to access and listen to changes in the inherited data, making it useful for managing application state and providing access to shared resources.

35. Q: How can you handle device orientation changes in a Flutter app?
    A: Device orientation changes in a Flutter app can be handled using the OrientationBuilder widget, which rebuilds its child widget based on the device's current orientation (portrait or landscape). Developers can use this widget to adjust the UI layout and behavior dynamically based on the device orientation.

36. Q: Explain the concept of "InheritedWidget propagation" in Flutter.
    A: InheritedWidget propagation in Flutter refers to the mechanism by which data provided by an InheritedWidget is propagated down the widget tree to descendant widgets. When the inherited data changes, Flutter automatically rebuilds the descendant widgets that depend on the data to reflect the changes.

## Additionals



1. **Background Process:**
   Background processing refers to executing tasks or operations while the app is not in the foreground, allowing the app to perform operations even when not actively used by the user. In Flutter, background processing can be achieved using plugins like `background_fetch` or `workmanager`, which allow developers to schedule and execute tasks in the background, such as syncing data, fetching updates, or processing notifications. These tasks typically run on a separate thread or isolate to avoid blocking the main UI thread.

2. **Isolates:**
   Isolates are Dart's solution for concurrent programming, allowing code to run in parallel on separate threads. Each isolate has its own memory heap, allowing it to run independently of other isolates without sharing memory. In Flutter, isolates are commonly used for performing CPU-intensive or long-running tasks in the background, such as processing data, performing computations, or handling network requests. Here's a simple example of using isolates in Flutter:

```dart
import 'dart:isolate';

void isolateFunction(SendPort sendPort) {
  // Perform background task
  // Send result back to main isolate
  sendPort.send('Background task completed');
}

void main() {
  ReceivePort receivePort = ReceivePort();
  Isolate.spawn(isolateFunction, receivePort.sendPort);
  receivePort.listen((data) {
    print('Received from isolate: $data');
  });
}
```

3. **Interceptors:**
   Interceptors are a concept commonly used in HTTP clients to intercept and modify requests or responses before they are sent or received. In Flutter, the `dio` package provides interceptors for intercepting HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors can be used for various purposes, such as adding headers, logging requests, handling errors, or modifying data. Here's an example of using interceptors with the `dio` package:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

void main() {
  Dio dio = Dio();
  dio.interceptors.add(InterceptorsWrapper(
    onRequest: (options, handler) {
      // Add custom headers
      options.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer token';
      return handler.next(options); // Pass the request on to the next interceptor
    },
    onResponse: (response, handler) {
      // Log response
      print('Response: ${response.data}');
      return handler.next(response); // Pass the response on to the next interceptor
    },
    onError: (DioError e, handler) {
      // Handle errors
      print('Error: ${e.message}');
      return handler.next(e); // Pass the error on to the next interceptor
    },
  ));
}
```

4. **Stream and its types:**
   Streams are a fundamental concept in Dart and Flutter for handling asynchronous data sequences. Streams provide a way to emit and receive a sequence of events over time. In Dart, there are two main types of streams: single-subscription streams and broadcast streams. Single-subscription streams allow only one listener to listen to the stream, while broadcast streams allow multiple listeners. Here's an example of using a stream in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  StreamController<int> controller = StreamController<int>();
  Stream<int> stream = controller.stream;

  // Add data to the stream
  controller.add(1);
  controller.add(2);
  controller.add(3);

  // Listen to the stream
  stream.listen((data) {
    print('Data: $data');
  });
}
```

5. **Animation and its types:**
   Animation in Flutter refers to the process of changing properties of widgets over time to create visual effects such as movement, rotation, scaling, fading, etc. There are various types of animations in Flutter, including implicit animations, explicit animations, and physics-based animations. Implicit animations, such as `AnimatedContainer` and `AnimatedOpacity`, automatically animate changes to widget properties. Explicit animations, such as `TweenAnimationBuilder` and `AnimatedBuilder`, allow developers to control the animation using Animation objects. Physics-based animations, such as `SpringSimulation` and `ScrollPhysics`, simulate real-world physics to create natural-looking animations.

6. **Mixins:**
   Mixins are a way to reuse code in Dart by adding functionality to a class without using inheritance. Mixins are declared using the `with` keyword and can be applied to any class. Mixins allow developers to add behavior to a class without creating a new subclass or modifying the existing class hierarchy. Here's an example of using mixins in Dart:

```dart
mixin Logger {
  void log(String message) {
    print('Log: $message');
  }
}

class MyClass with Logger {
  void doSomething() {
    log('Doing something...');
  }
}

void main() {
  MyClass().doSomething(); // Output: Log: Doing something...
}
```

7. **Extensions:**
   Extensions in Dart allow developers to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying the original class or creating a subclass. Extensions provide a way to add methods, getters, or setters to existing classes, making it easier to extend and enhance their functionality. Here's an example of using extensions in Dart:

```dart
extension StringExtension on String {
  String capitalize() {
    return '${this.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase()}${this.substring(1)}';
  }
}

void main() {
  String text = 'hello';
  print(text.capitalize()); // Output: Hello
}
```

8. **Flutter Architecture (SDK):**
   Flutter architecture refers to the design and structure of Flutter apps, including how they are organized, how data flows through the app, and how UI components are built and managed. Flutter apps typically follow a reactive and component-based architecture, where UI components are composed of smaller widgets, and data flows from parent widgets to child widgets through a unidirectional data
   flow. Flutter SDK provides various tools and patterns for building scalable and maintainable architectures, including:

- **Widget-based architecture:** Flutter apps are built using a tree of widgets, where each widget represents a UI component. Widgets are composable and can be combined to create complex UIs. The Flutter SDK provides a rich set of built-in widgets and layout systems for building UIs.

- **State management:** Flutter offers several options for managing application state, including StatefulWidget, Provider, Riverpod, BLoC (Business Logic Component), Redux, MobX, and more. These patterns allow developers to manage and synchronize state data across the app efficiently.

- **Dependency injection:** Dependency injection is a technique used to provide dependencies (such as services, repositories, or managers) to objects throughout the app. Flutter SDK does not have built-in dependency injection, but developers can use packages like Provider, GetIt, or injectable for managing dependencies in Flutter apps.

- **Routing and navigation:** Flutter provides a built-in navigation system for managing navigation between screens or routes in an app. Developers can use the Navigator widget and MaterialApp's routing capabilities to define routes, navigate between screens, and pass arguments between routes.

- **Platform channels:** Flutter allows communication between Flutter code and platform-specific code (such as Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS) using platform channels. This enables Flutter apps to access platform-specific features and APIs not directly available through Flutter.

- **Testing:** Flutter SDK includes built-in support for unit testing, widget testing, and integration testing. Developers can write tests using the Flutter test framework and tools like Mockito for mocking dependencies. Testing is an essential part of building reliable and maintainable Flutter apps.

- **Performance optimization:** Flutter SDK provides tools and techniques for optimizing the performance of Flutter apps, including minimizing widget rebuilds, reducing unnecessary animations, optimizing image loading and caching, and profiling the app to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

Overall, Flutter SDK offers a flexible and powerful framework for building cross-platform apps with a robust architecture, allowing developers to create high-quality apps that are easy to maintain and scale.

9. **Widget lifecycle:**
   Understanding the lifecycle of widgets is crucial for managing state and resources efficiently in a Flutter app. Widgets in Flutter go through various lifecycle stages from creation to destruction. The typical lifecycle stages of a StatefulWidget include:

   - **createState:** This is called when the widget is instantiated and added to the widget tree. It creates the associated State object.
   
   - **initState:** This is called once when the State object is created. It is used for initializing state data and subscribing to streams or animations.
   
   - **didChangeDependencies:** This is called when the dependencies of the widget change. It is often used for initializing data that depends on inherited widgets.
   
   - **build:** This is called whenever the widget needs to rebuild its UI, typically in response to changes in state or props.
   
   - **didUpdateWidget:** This is called when the widget is rebuilt with a new instance of the same widget type but with different properties. It is used for updating the state based on changes in props.
   
   - **setState:** This is called when the widget needs to rebuild its UI in response to changes in state. It triggers a rebuild of the widget subtree.
   
   - **dispose:** This is called when the widget is removed from the widget tree. It is used for cleaning up resources, such as canceling subscriptions or disposing of controllers.

10. **Freezed package:**
    The freezed package is a code generation library for Dart that simplifies the creation of immutable data models and value objects. It allows developers to annotate Dart classes with @freezed and @immutable annotations to generate boilerplate code for immutable data types, including equality and hash code methods, copyWith method, and more. Freezed eliminates the need to write repetitive boilerplate code for immutable classes manually, making code more concise, readable, and maintainable. Here's an example of using the freezed package:

    ```dart
    import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

    part 'user.freezed.dart';

    @freezed
    abstract class User with _$User {
      const factory User({String name, int age}) = _User;
    }
    ```

    The above code generates the following boilerplate code:

    ```dart
    @immutable
    abstract class User {
      const factory User({String name, int age}) = _User;

      String get name;
      int get age;

      const User._();
    }
    ```

11. **Singletons:**
    Singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In Dart, singletons can be implemented using static variables and factory constructors. Here's an example of implementing a singleton in Dart:

    ```dart
    class MySingleton {
      static final MySingleton _instance = MySingleton._internal();

      factory MySingleton() {
        return _instance;
      }

      MySingleton._internal();

      void doSomething() {
        print('Singleton instance is doing something.');
      }
    }
    ```

    Usage:

    ```dart
    MySingleton singleton = MySingleton();
    singleton.doSomething(); // Output: Singleton instance is doing something.
    ```

12. **Dependency injections:**
    Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to manage the dependencies of a class by providing them from external sources rather than creating them internally. In Flutter, dependency injection can be achieved using packages like Provider, GetIt, or injectable. These packages allow developers to register dependencies and retrieve them throughout the app, promoting code reuse, testability, and maintainability. Here's an example of using Provider for dependency injection in Flutter:

    ```dart
    // Define a dependency
    class MyService {
      void doSomething() {
        print('Doing something...');
      }
    }

    // Register the dependency using Provider
    runApp(
      Provider(
        create: (_) => MyService(),
        child: MyApp(),
      ),
    );

    // Retrieve the dependency in a widget
    class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        final MyService myService = Provider.of<MyService>(context);
        myService.doSomething();
        return Container();
      }
    }
    ```

13. **RxDart:**
    RxDart is a reactive programming library for Dart that provides a rich set of tools and utilities for working with reactive streams. It extends Dart's built-in Stream API with additional features such as observables, subjects, operators, and more, making it easier to work with asynchronous data streams in Dart and Flutter apps. RxDart follows the principles of ReactiveX and provides operators for transforming, combining, and reacting to streams in a declarative and composable way. Here's an example of using RxDart to create and manipulate streams:

    ```dart
    import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

    void main() {
      // Create a stream
      final Stream<int> stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

      // Transform stream using map operator
      final transformedStream = stream.map((value) => value * 2);

      // Subscribe to the transformed stream
      transformedStream.listen((value) {
        print(value); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
      });
    }
    ```

14. **Background Process:**

Background processing refers to executing tasks or operations while the application is not actively in use or in the foreground. This is essential for performing tasks that don't require user interaction or immediate attention but still need to be executed efficiently. In Flutter, background processing can be achieved using platform-specific APIs or plugins.

Example: Implementing periodic tasks using the WorkManager plugin in Flutter for Android:

```dart
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';

void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager.executeTask((task, inputData) {
    print("Background task executed");
    // Perform background task here
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}

void main() {
  Workmanager.initialize(callbackDispatcher);
  Workmanager.registerPeriodicTask(
    "1",
    "backgroundTask",
    frequency: Duration(hours: 1),
  );
}
```


15. **Flutter Architecture (SDK):**

Flutter provides a flexible and scalable architecture for building applications, allowing developers to structure their code in a way that promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. While Flutter itself does not enforce a specific architecture, it provides tools and patterns that developers can use to design their app architecture.

Example: Implementing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture pattern in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

// Define events
enum CounterEvent { increment, decrement }

// Define state
class CounterState {
  final int count;

  CounterState(this.count);
}

// Define BLoC
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterState(0));

  @override
  Stream<CounterState> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    if (event == CounterEvent.increment) {
      yield CounterState(state.count + 1);
    } else if (event == CounterEvent.decrement) {
      yield CounterState(state.count - 1);
    }
  }
}

// Widget using the BLoC
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, CounterState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          return Center(
            child: Text(
              '${state.count}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
        children: [
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () =>
                context.read<CounterBloc>().add(CounterEvent.increment),
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 16),
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () =>
                context.read<CounterBloc>().add(CounterEvent.decrement),
            child: Icon(Icons.remove),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: BlocProvider(
        create: (_) => CounterBloc(),
        child: CounterPage(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

Riverpod is a state management library for Flutter that provides a simple and intuitive way to manage application state and dependencies. It is built on top of the Provider package and offers a more flexible and modern approach to dependency injection and state management. Riverpod introduces the concept of "providers" to manage state and dependencies, making it easy to access and update state throughout the app.

Let's illustrate Riverpod with an example of a simple counter app:

First, you need to add the Riverpod dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  riverpod: ^0.14.0+3
```

Then, you can create a Riverpod provider for managing the state of the counter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

// Define a Riverpod provider for the counter state
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProviderScope(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Riverpod Counter',
        home: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override

- We define a Riverpod provider named `counterProvider` using the `StateProvider` constructor. This provider manages the state of the counter and initializes it with a value of 0.

- We wrap our app with a `ProviderScope` widget to create the scope for providers to be accessed within the widget tree.

- In the `CounterPage` widget, we use the `Consumer` widget to listen to changes in the counter state. The `watch` function is used to watch the state of the `counterProvider`, and the counter value is extracted using `.state`.

- When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, we increment the counter state by accessing the provider using `context.read(counterProvider)` and updating its state.
