# Generative AI QnA

**Q1: What is Image Classification?**

**A1:**
Image Classification is the task of assigning a label to an image based on its content using machine learning models. It is widely used in applications like object recognition, medical imaging, and automated tagging.

**Q2: Which models are commonly used for Image Classification?**

**A2:**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for Image Classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. Popular architectures include VGG, ResNet, and Inception.

**Code Snippet: Image Classification using a Pre-trained ResNet Model**

```python
from torchvision import models, transforms
from PIL import Image
import torch

# Load pre-trained ResNet model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Transform input image
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load and preprocess image
img = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg')
img_t = preprocess(img)
batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

# Classify image
with torch.no_grad():
    out = model(batch_t)

# Get top-5 predictions
_, indices = torch.topk(out, 5)
percentage = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out, dim=1)[0] * 100
labels = {idx: label for idx, label in enumerate(open('imagenet_classes.txt').read().splitlines())}
for idx in indices[0]:
    print(labels[idx.item()], percentage[idx].item())
```

### Additional Explanations

#### LLMs (Embeddings)

**Q1: What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

**A1:**
Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. These models, such as GPT-3, BERT, and others, can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks by leveraging embeddings, which are dense vector representations of text.

#### Mixtral, Llama2, Llama3, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Phi-2, Mixtral-Embeddings

**Q1: Can you explain some notable LLMs and their use cases?**

**A1:**
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** Known for its text generation capabilities, used in chatbots, content creation, and more.
- **Llama2 and Llama3:** Models developed for specific applications with optimized architectures for efficiency and performance.
- **Azure OpenAI:** Microsoft's implementation providing access to OpenAI's models with enterprise-level support and integration.
- **Ollama and Phi-2:** Specialized models designed for particular industries or tasks, optimizing performance for specific use cases.
- **Mixtral and Mixtral-Embeddings:** Designed for multilingual and cross-lingual tasks, providing embeddings that capture meanings across different languages.

#### Frameworks: Langchain, Langgraph, SQL Expert

**Q1: How do frameworks like Langchain and Langgraph enhance the use of LLMs?**

**A1:**
- **Langchain:** Facilitates the creation of complex NLP applications by providing tools to chain different NLP components. It supports various models and tokenizers, making it easier to build sophisticated applications.
- **Langgraph:** Integrates graph databases with language models to handle complex relationships and large-scale data efficiently. This is particularly useful for tasks that involve extensive querying and relationship management.
- **SQL Expert:** Ensures efficient data management and querying in NLP workflows, allowing seamless integration of SQL databases with machine learning models.

### Example Use Cases for Frameworks and LLMs

#### Langchain Example

**Q1: How can Langchain be used in a practical NLP application?**

**A1:**
Langchain can be used to create a sentiment analysis pipeline that chains together a tokenizer, a transformer model for embeddings, and a sentiment classifier.

**Code Snippet: Sentiment Analysis Pipeline using Langchain**

```python
from langchain import Tokenizer, Transformer, SentimentClassifier

# Initialize components
tokenizer = Tokenizer(model='gpt2')
transformer = Transformer(model='bert-base-uncased')
classifier = SentimentClassifier(model='distilbert-base-uncased')

# Example text
text = "I love using Langchain for building NLP applications!"

# Tokenize, generate embeddings, and classify sentiment
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
embeddings = transformer.generate_embeddings(tokens)
sentiment = classifier.classify(embeddings)

print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
```

#### Langgraph Example

**Q1: How can Langgraph be applied in an NLP task?**

**A1:**
Langgraph can be used to analyze relationships in a large corpus of scientific articles, identifying how different research topics are interconnected.

**Code Snippet: Analyzing Relationships with Langgraph**

```python
from langgraph import GraphDatabase, LangModel

# Connect to graph database
graph_db = GraphDatabase(uri='bolt://localhost:7687', user='neo4j', password='password')

# Initialize language model
lang_model = LangModel(model='bert-base-uncased')

# Example text
text = "Artificial intelligence is impacting various fields, including healthcare and finance."

# Generate embeddings and store relationships in graph database
embeddings = lang_model.generate_embeddings(text)
graph_db.store_embeddings(embeddings)

# Query the graph database
query_result = graph_db.query("MATCH (n:Entity)-[r:RELATES_TO]->(m:Entity) RETURN n, r, m")
print(query_result)
```
