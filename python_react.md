## 2. Python (FastAPI) for Backend Development

### Concept:
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Example:
Creating a simple FastAPI application:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```
This example creates a basic FastAPI application with a single endpoint that returns a JSON response.

## 3. State Management using MobX

### Concept:
MobX is a state management library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).

### Example:
Using MobX in a React application:
```jsx
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';

class TodoStore {
  @observable todos = [];
  
  @action addTodo = (todo) => {
    this.todos.push(todo);
  }
}

const store = new TodoStore();

const TodoList = observer(() => (
  <ul>
    {store.todos.map((todo, index) => <li key={index}>{todo}</li>)}
  </ul>
));
```
This example shows how to define an observable store and an action in MobX, and how to use the `observer` decorator to make a React component reactive to state changes.

## 4. Authentication using OpenID and OAuth

### Concept:
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

### Example:
Implementing OAuth2 with FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/me")
async def read_users_me(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    return {"token": token}
```
In this example, the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` class is used to define the OAuth2 scheme, and the `Depends` function is used to get the token.

## 5. Azure Cloud CDN for Content Delivery

### Concept:
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a global CDN solution for delivering high-bandwidth content. It caches static content at strategically located physical nodes across the world to provide maximum throughput and lower latency.

### Example:
Setting up Azure CDN with your web application:
1. Create a CDN profile in the Azure portal.
2. Create a CDN endpoint within the profile.
3. Configure your web application to serve static assets through the CDN endpoint URL.

## 6. Azure Service Bus for Messaging

### Concept:
Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. It is used to decouple applications and services.

### Example:
Sending messages to Azure Service Bus:
```python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient, ServiceBusMessage

conn_str = 'YOUR_SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING'
queue_name = 'YOUR_QUEUE_NAME'

servicebus_client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(conn_str)
with servicebus_client:
    sender = servicebus_client.get_queue_sender(queue_name=queue_name)
    with sender:
        message = ServiceBusMessage("Sample message")
        sender.send_messages(message)
```
In this example, a message is sent to an Azure Service Bus queue using the Service Bus SDK for Python.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Azure Monitor

### Concept:
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model and query language. Grafana is used for analytics and monitoring, and Azure Monitor provides full-stack monitoring for applications and services in Azure.

### Example:
Configuring Prometheus to scrape metrics from a FastAPI application:
1. Install `prometheus-client` library in your FastAPI application.
2. Create a metrics endpoint:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from prometheus_client import Counter, generate_latest

app = FastAPI()

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter("request_count", "Total number of requests")

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    REQUEST_COUNT.inc()
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/metrics")
def get_metrics():
    return generate_latest()
```
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape the `/metrics` endpoint of your application.

## 8. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Concept:
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD solution that automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline.

### Example:
Creating a simple GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
```
In this example, a GitHub Actions workflow is defined to check out the code, set up Python, install dependencies, and run tests on every push to the main branch.

## 9. Agile/Scrum Development Environment

### Concept:
Agile is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Scrum is an Agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

### Example:
Participating in Scrum ceremonies:
- **Sprint Planning**: Define the work to be done during the sprint.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Short meetings to discuss progress and any blockers.
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate the work completed during the sprint.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement.

## Preparing for the Interview

1. **Review the Concepts**: Understand each concept mentioned in the job description and be able to explain them clearly.
2. **Practical Experience**: Make sure you have hands-on experience with the technologies and tools listed.
3. **Examples**: Be prepared to provide examples of projects or tasks you have completed using these technologies.
4. **Problem-Solving**: Demonstrate your problem-solving skills by discussing challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
5. **Teamwork and Communication**: Highlight your experience working in teams and your communication skills.

By understanding and practicing these concepts, you will be well-prepared for your interview. Good luck!
