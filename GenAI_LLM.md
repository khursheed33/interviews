- **Early layers**: Detect edges, corners, simple patterns
- **Deep layers**: Detect complex objects, semantic features
- **Visualization**: Show what features the network learns
- **Size reduction**: Pooling reduces feature map dimensions

### 95. What is the difference between generative and discriminative models?
**Answer:**
- **Generative**: Model P(x,y) or P(x), can generate new samples
  - Examples: GANs, VAEs, Naive Bayes
- **Discriminative**: Model P(y|x), focus on decision boundaries
  - Examples: Logistic regression, SVMs, most classifiers
- **Trade-offs**: Generative more flexible, discriminative often better for classification

### 96. How do you handle variable-length sequences in deep learning?
**Answer:**
- **Padding**: Add zeros to make sequences same length
- **Masking**: Ignore padded positions in loss computation
- **Packing**: Group sequences of similar length
- **Recurrent networks**: Naturally handle variable lengths
- **Attention**: Can handle different sequence lengths

### 97. What are the computational considerations for deep learning?
**Answer:**
- **Memory**: Model size, batch size, gradient storage
- **Computation**: Matrix operations, parallel processing
- **Hardware**: GPUs for parallel computation, TPUs for specific workloads
- **Optimization**: Mixed precision, gradient accumulation
- **Distributed training**: Multiple GPUs/machines

### 98. Explain the concept of curriculum learning.
**Answer:** Training strategy that presents examples in meaningful order:
- **Easy to hard**: Start with simple examples, gradually increase difficulty
- **Benefits**: Faster convergence, better final performance
- **Applications**: Machine translation, computer vision
- **Self-paced**: Let model determine difficulty automatically

### 99. What are the emerging trends in deep learning?
**Answer:**
- **Transformer architectures**: Attention-based models
- **Self-supervised learning**: Learning without labels
- **Neural architecture search**: Automated model design
- **Efficient models**: MobileNets, EfficientNets
- **Continual learning**: Learning new tasks without forgetting
- **Federated learning**: Privacy-preserving distributed training

### 100. How do you ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments?
**Answer:**
- **Random seeds**: Set seeds for random number generators
- **Environment**: Document software versions, hardware specs
- **Code versioning**: Use git for code management
- **Data versioning**: Track dataset versions and preprocessing
- **Hyperparameters**: Log all experimental settings
- **Results tracking**: Use tools like MLflow, Weights & Biases
